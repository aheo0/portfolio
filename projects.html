                            <p>The object for our Scratch project was to create 
                            either a story or a game with my partner, Josh Koh, 
                            that demonstrates our knowledge of programming 
                            fundamentals and our ability to use the Scratch 
                            interface. In the beginning, Josh and I concluded 
                            that we wanted to create a story with user inputs—
                            like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” type. In our 
                            Scratch story code, we also displayed our creativity 
                            with not only the story outline but with the effect 
                            we added to the buttons the user clicks on to input 
                            their choice in between scenes. Our button increases 
                            in size when the mouse cursor hovers above it. 
                            Additionally our project intakes the username so 
                            that our characters in our story can make humorous 
                            remarks at the user. A challenge we were forced to 
                            overcome was the time constraint of the project. 
                            Initially, we planned for many different paths the 
                            main character could take, but as the due date of 
                            the project came closer, we realized that we would 
                            need to somehow combine all our ideas in a condensed 
                            scene. In the end, we did manage to include all of 
                            our ideas that we had planned to include although 
                            our story could definitely have been better given 
                            more time. I hope that in future projects, our class 
                            would have more sufficient amount of time for us to 
                            include all of our creativity. During the project, 
                            Josh and I shared every work done which included the 
                            programming portion, the background image creation, 
                            and the <a target="_blank" href="Projects HTML/scratch-24 Hours to Die.pdf">
                            Project Notebook</a> where stored all of our 
                            information professionally. Our Project Notebook 
                            includes our brainstorming, the daily log of what 
                            Josh and I did, and the feedback we gained from the 
                            gallery walk we did in class. Since the Project 
                            Notebook was required, I felt at first it was some 
                            extra work. However at the end of the project, the 
                            organization felt amazing to look over and now I 
                            plan to create my own Project Notebook whenever I do 
                            a project in my free time.</p>
