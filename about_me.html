                    <p>Programming, academics, Boy Scoutsâ€”these are the words 
                    that describe me. Hello, my name is Apollo Heo, and I am 
                    currently enrolled to Dublin High School as a freshman with 
                    aspiring hopes and goals for the 4 years I will be spending 
                    in high school. Ever since I was young, I have always 
                    enjoyed technology in the ever-changing world we now live 
                    in, and have wanted to leave my own legacy on the internet. 
                    Already on my path to become a programmer, I am in the 
                    Robotics Club to apply my developing programming skills.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>As I spent my last 3 years in middle school, there are 
                    some accomplishments that I am proud of. I have talent in 
                    math and got a perfect score on the AMC 8, which only 75 
                    people got worldwide, myself included. I also qualified for 
                    the Nationals competition in MATHCOUNTS at Washington D.C. 
                    in May 2018 where I met other mathletes whom I later 
                    competed with. In school I was also advanced for my age, 
                    taking Honors Precalculus in middle school and now taking AP 
                    Statistics as a freshman. From these rigorous courses, I 
                    have enhanced my problem solving skills that I hope to use 
                    to enhance my programming.</p>
                    <h4 id="resume_header">3</h4>
                    <p>In my free time, I like to explore the different 
                    programming languages out, but as of now, Python is my 
                    favorite. As part of the Gael Force Robotics Club, I also 
                    plan to master C++ in order to apply my programming skills 
                    in</p>
