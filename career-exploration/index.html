                        <p>During my time in high school, I have gained work experience through my volunteer work. From volunteering at my local children’s museum, I worked with others to organize and execute activities, leading other volunteers. I gained important skills necessary for helping the overall organization succeed through clear communication and organization. I also helped contribute to the financial aspect of the organization, planning out and executing fundraisers, as well as logging expenses. From this experience, I’ve also learned I enjoy working on engineering projects with peers and developing stuff with my hands.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards, I did more research into professions that involve the characteristics I enjoyed about this volunteering experience, and other experiences. I realized my field of interest is closely related to mechanical or electrical engineering, and I am looking to get a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. I’ve researched potential internships, and I aspire to apply to companies like NVIDIA for an undergraduate summer internship, where I would be able to work in an environment that allows me to become familiarized with how a large corporation functions, while also learning about the development process for recent innovations in engineering. I’ve reached out and spoken to a past intern there, and his responses has only corroborated my expectations and motives.</p>
