                    <p>Programming, academics—these are the words that describe me. Hello, my name is Apollo Heo, and I am currently enrolled to Dublin High School as a senior with aspiring hopes and goals for the next year of high school and the future. Ever since I was young, I have always enjoyed technology in the ever-changing world we now live in, and have wanted to leave my own legacy on the internet. In my free time, I program various tasks that automate simple repetitive tasks.</p>
                    <p>I have done VEX Robotics for two years and have qualified for Worlds. I have also mentored a middle school VEX team (2416X) where I applied the skills I gained from my team to teach younger kids and expose them to engineering skills typically not covered in school curriculums, while also preparing them for their competitions. I also aimed to expose younger kids to STEM through Valley's Children Museum, a local non-profit organization that weekly (and twice a week over the summer) provides stations where the kids can create various projects, perform scientific experiments, or watch demonstrations that further enhance their scientific knowledge while simultaneously adding interest in STEM fields.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I like to build programming projects. Beside these programming projects, I also study algorithms through the United States Computing Olympiad (USACO) and mathematics beyond those taught in school through the American Mathematics Competition (AMC).</p>
                    <p>Thank you for your time reading about myself. As a student, I’m currently trying to learn new skills and add to my portfolio. If you would like to explore more about me, feel free to explore the rest of my application or contact me at apollobest03@gmail.com.</p>
