                    <p>Programming, academicsâ€”these are the words 
                    that describe me. Hello, my name is Apollo Heo, and I am 
                    currently enrolled to Dublin High School as a junior with 
                    aspiring hopes and goals for the next 2 years I will be spending 
                    in high school. Ever since I was young, I have always 
                    enjoyed technology in the ever-changing world we now live 
                    in, and have wanted to leave my own legacy on the internet. 
                    In my free time, I program various tasks that automate simple
                    repetitive tasks.</p>
                    <p>I have done VEX Robotics for two years and have qualified for 
                    Worlds (the second year's was cancelled due to COVID). I have also
                    mentored a middle school VEX team (2416X) where I applied the skills
                    I gained from my team to teach younger kids and expose them to
                    engineering skills typically not covered in school cirriculums, while
                    also preparing them for their competitions. I also aimed to expose
                    younger kids to STEM through Valley's Children Museum, a local
                    non-profit organization that weekly (and twice a week over the summer)
                    provides stations where the kids can create various projects,
                    perform scientific experiments, or watch demonstrations that further
                    enhance their scientific knowledge while simultaneously adding interest
                    in STEM fields.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I like to build programming projects. Some examples
                    in the past have been a blog template, using SQL database and with
                    custom back-end and front-end support, a Discord bot, made using its API,
                    that controls up to 10,000 people's voice permissions at a time, and 
                    a logistic model that attempted to predict the spread of COVID when it 
                    first came out using data web-scraped from online government databases.</p>
                    <p>Beside these programming projects, I also study algorithms through the
                    United States Computing Olympiad (USACO) and mathematics beyond those
                    taught in school through the American Mathematics Competition (AMC).
