                            <p>When we discussed ideas, we tried to extend what 
                            we considered to be a “basic hangman game” and 
                            developed ideas that other games contained. For 
                            example, most games feature a username and a score 
                            feature so we created a scoreboard. We also 
                            developed further on the idea of ASCII Art into 
                            ASCII Animation. Also, another idea we thought of 
                            was the process of deleting each screen and 
                            reprinting, giving a smooth transition most, if not 
                            all, modern games possess. What helped a lot for 
                            this project was that we had the exact same 
                            partner. Moreso, we could import functions that we 
                            had made for the Text Adventure Project. This 
                            benefitted us extremely well as we had faced, and 
                            overcame, most of the difficulties during the last 
                            creation, i.e. colored text and terminal 
                            manipulation. Similarly to our Text Adventure 
                            Project after we discussed the design, we each 
                            worked on a separate portion of the project 
                            simultaneously; this dynamic partnership created 
                            the perfect balance and efficiency for the 
                            completion of the tasks. Additionally, a very 
                            important aspect, as well as it may be obvious and 
                            have been said for the Text Adventure Project, that 
                            was critical for our Hangman Game was 
                            communication. We used Discord to communicate, log 
                            each change we made in the <a target="_blank" href="../Projects HTML/python-hangman.pdf">
                            Project Notebook</a> and reported each other of 
                            bugs, possible bugs that have yet to be tested, and 
                            more detailed description of feature we plan to or 
                            have implemented in our game.</p>
